# NFT Museum
A flutter project to explore the world of NFTs and APIs

### Purpose of this project
The purpose of this project is to explore the flutter and NFT APIs at the same time. When I saw that there are very less applications which just shows NFTs and no other crap, I decided to hope on this journey. This project is a ~~simple~~ complex application with ton of APIs talking to each other and rendering data while handling possible exceptions. The UI is fully written in `dart` programming language using `flutter` library and for data `Rarible API` has been used. I have not written the backend, it's all APIs talking to each other.

### UI sample
The UI is made simple and minimal, yet beautiful.
